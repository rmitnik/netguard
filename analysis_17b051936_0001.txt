Project: netguard

Purpouse: protect servers against intrusions and generate logs with info about actions done 

Prototype:
   netguard_1.0

   Use:
     netguard_1.0 -i interface -l logfile 
        interface: eth0 by default
        logfile: netguard.log, rotate automatically in netguard.log.YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS for each new scan.
   
   Perform:
      [0] Launch "tcpdump " command, where $1 is the interface and $2 is the netguard.log file
      [1] Pass filtered http and https ip activity
      [2] Launch a thread for each ip that does a suspicious activity according with the parameters done
          in the netguard.cfg file, this config file will be generate by another program/script for configure the tools.

                              banip ip1 netmask
              
           sshguard: script that analyce tryes of access to the system via ssh

Developping methodology: 
    Cicle:
    [0] analysis -> [1] prototype -> [2] launch functional version -> [3] test -> [0]
